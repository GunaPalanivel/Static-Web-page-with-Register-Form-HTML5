## Introduction

**stack.dev** focuses on Full Stack Development, which involves building both the front-end (client-side) and back-end (server-side) portions of web applications. This repository provides educational content, articles, and video resources to help you understand and excel in various aspects of full-stack development.

## Front End

The front-end is all about creating the user interface and experience. It involves technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here are some key technologies in the front-end realm:

- HTML: Hyper Text Markup Language
- CSS: Cascading Style Sheets
- JavaScript: Interactive scripting language

For more details on front-end libraries and frameworks, refer to the [Front End Libraries and Frameworks](#front-end-libraries-and-frameworks) section.

## Back End

The back-end is responsible for server-side logic and data handling. It involves technologies like PHP, Python, Java, Node.js, and more. Here are some key back-end technologies:

- PHP: Server-side scripting language
- Python: General-purpose programming language
- Node.js: JavaScript runtime for server-side development

Learn more about back-end frameworks and languages.

## Database

The database is where data is stored, managed, and retrieved. It plays a crucial role in web applications. Here are some database technologies:
